I will be analyzing data for this project using the technique described in Dr. Natasha Holmes' Statistics Summary, a professor of physics at Cornell. In order to ascertain whether two sets of measures differ significantly or are too similar to distinguish from one another, the analysis compares them. Sections 1-3 of Holmes' guidebook go into detail about this procedure.
